### Hi there 👋

I am Master Student in Data Science and Applied Information at Lucerne University of Applied Sciences, exploring the Data Science universe 🌌

🔭 I’m currently working on implementing Data Science in Construction Safety Management as my thesis topic. I am creating Machine learning algorithims to predict accidents on site ⚠️👷‍♂️.

I complete several fun and creative projects:

- Data Base Management -> Restaurant Reviews in the USA 🍴
- Web Scraping (Collection, Integration & Preprocessing) -> Crypto Trend Analyzer 💰📈
- Data Visualization (Tableau) -> Tourism in Switzerland 🕴🌍
- Exploratory Data Analysis -> Australian Wildfires 🔥
- Machine Learning -> ML in Speed Dating 💏
- Machine Learning -> ML in Heart Disease 💔
- Deep Learning -> Recycling waste ♻️
- Deep Learning -> Identification of Spam Messages ✉️🚫
